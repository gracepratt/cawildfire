## How differing climate scenarios affect wildfire impacts on California endangered species

[You can find the final output for this project here](https://github.com/gracepratt/cawildfire/blob/master/docs/project.md)

For this project, I looked at how predicted wildfire scenarios differ based on different climate change scenarios, particularly different drought scenarios. I specifically be compared 2 climate models: the CNRM-CM5 climate model, which generally has cooler and wetter predictions for future California climates, and the HadGEM2-ES model, which includes higher predicted temperatures and long-term future drought scenarios for California.

I then looked at how these predicted scenarios will impact the critical habitats of 2 endangered species: the Sierra Nevada yellow-legged frog and the California condor. 

### Questions that were asked:
- How do predicted wildfire scenarios differ between the CNRM-CM5 and HadGEM2-ES climate models?
- Where in California do we expect increases in wildfires?
- How will the habitats of California endangered species be affected by future climate scenarios?

### Skills used:
- Writing / working with custom R functions
- Interaction with an API
- Parsing extensible data formats (JSON, XML)
- Use of spatial vector data (sf package) and visualization of spatial data
