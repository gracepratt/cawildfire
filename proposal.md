# Final project proposal: How differing climate scenarios affect wildfire impacts on California endangered species
### *Grace Pratt*

For this project, I am going to look at how predicted wildfire scenarios differ based on different climate change scenarios, particularly different drought scenarios. I will specifically be comparing 2 climate models: the CNRM-CM5 climate model, which generally has cooler and wetter predictions for future California climates, and the HadGEM2-ES model, which includes higher predicted temperatures and long-term future drought scenarios for California. 

In order to explore how future long-term drought could impact wildfire scenarios, I am going to use data from the [CalAdapt website](https://cal-adapt.org/data/wildfire/), which contains predicted wildfire scenarios for the entire state of California for a variety of different climate models, including CNRM-CM5 and HadGEM2-ES. In order to see the role that drought vs non-drought warming scenarios will have, I will be comparing projections from the years 2046â€“2074, during which the HadGEM2-ES model shows a future drought. 

In order to see how these wildfires could impact species in California, I will be comparing the [current critical habitats](https://ecos.fws.gov/ecp/report/table/critical-habitat.html) of a few of California's endangered species to see how much of it is potentially impacted by future wildfires. I want to pick species whose natural habitat is impacted by changing wildfire scenarios. Given some personal knowledge of California ecology, I anticipate that one impacted area will be the Sierra Nevada mountain range. Therefore, I am planning on looking at wildfire in the critical habitats of the Sierra Nevada Bighorn Sheep and Yosemite Toad. If after my intial analysis, I discover that the Sierras aren't impacted as much as anticipated, I may choose different species to look at.

### Questions that will be asked

- How do predicted wildfire scenarios differ between the CNRM-CM5 and HadGEM2-ES climate models?
- Where in California do we expect increases in wildfires?
- How will the habitats of California endangered species be affected by future climate scenarios?

### Data Required

- Spatial data on future wildfire predictions using the [CalAdapt API](https://cal-adapt.org/data/wildfire/)
- Spatial data on current critical habitat in California for different species downloaded from the [U.S. FWS Threatened & Endangered Species Active Critical Habitat Report](https://ecos.fws.gov/ecp/report/table/critical-habitat.html)


### Anticipated skills to be used (this list may be modified):

- Use of at least 5 `dplyr` verbs / functions
- Writing / working with custom R functions
- Interaction with an API
- Parsing extensible data formats (JSON, XML)
- Use of spatial vector data (`sf` package) and visualization of spatial data
